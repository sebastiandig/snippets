# snippets
All of the snippets I personally use and the ones that are default. Credit is given to ones that I did not create. 

Most frequently used are:
* lib
* for
* if
* tidyverse
* r2
* hdr
* mm
* fun_head (only used in project functions; will NOT be used when creating packages)
* plonger
* pwider
